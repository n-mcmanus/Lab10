## beepr beeps

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# writing for loop
for (i in rev(seq(1:9999))) {
  
  print(paste(i, "bottles of beer on the wall")) #paste adds space
  
}

beep(5)
```


## praise and cowsay

Packages built with a single purpose: to be kind and fun.

```{r}
praise("${Exclamation}, ${EXCLAMATION} ... ${exclamation}!!!!")

praise("Holy ${creating}, Batman - this code is ${ADJECTIVE}!")
```

Use cowsay::say() to make a character say something to you

```{r}
say("Obey", by = "hypnotoad")
```
